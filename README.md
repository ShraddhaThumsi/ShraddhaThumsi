- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShraddhaThumsi

- 🌱 I’m currently working in Alterest, a fintech platform that provides a smart portfolio management system for bank and non-bank investors. 
- 💞️ I have experience in Python, Redshift SQL, Scala and Java from my previous experience
- I want to collaborate with other fintech enthusiasts to build pet projects on lifetime expected credit losses.
