- 🌱 I’m currently working in Alterest, a fintech platform that provides a smart portfolio management system for bank and non-bank investors.
- I have also been a Research Assistant at University of Arizona, researching on event-context relations in medical publications on cancer. Hit me up to know more!
- 💞️ I have experience in Python, Redshift SQL, Scala and Java from my previous experience
